# Solutions to Graph algorithms course at AGH UST
This repository contains solutions for exercises performed during the Graph
algorithms course at the AGH. Tasks descriptions (written in Polish) can be
accessed [here](https://marcinlos.github.io/algograf/).

There are also two small projects here with solutions to problems connected
with graphs.

## Topics of laboratories

| Laboratory  | Description of problem |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Lab1](https://github.com/dadamczykk/graph-algorithms/tree/master/lab1)  | Finding path with given constraint using three methods  |
| [Lab2](https://github.com/dadamczykk/graph-algorithms/tree/master/lab2)  | Maximum flow using Ford-Fulkerson method  |
| [Lab3&4](https://github.com/dadamczykk/graph-algorithms/tree/master/lab3%264) | Minimum cut problem with Stoer-Wagner algorithm |
| [Lab5&6](https://github.com/dadamczykk/graph-algorithms/tree/master/lab5%266) | Lexicographic BFS implementation and chordal graphs  |
| [Lab7](https://github.com/dadamczykk/graph-algorithms/tree/master/lab7) | Solutions to graph problems with NetworkX library, 2-SAT problem  |

Every laboratory has some tests included (in folders graphs). There is also
script (that was attached to tasks descriptions) for loading graphs.
Additionally, I wrote a simple tester for easy execution of tests
on written functions.
